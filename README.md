RGDataBrowser
=============

A configurable iOS template for browsing remote data sets

This project can be used as a starting point if you want to build an app that shows structured data sets. In this example, it reads from a Google docs spreadsheet and parses the JSON feed. The data is stored in Core Data. The following components are used:

* MagicalRecord - makes Core Data easier, especially importing
* Kiwi for testing (pending)
* AFNetworking - makes everything around networking calls easier
* ideas from http://www.objc.io/issue-1/lighter-view-controllers.html are used
